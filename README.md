## Repository about needs and directions for development of Polish science.
###### Hi, 
###### I would like to start a project, where anybody can add some ideas or comments regarding the development of Polish science. Most probably it will be kept as latex file, but maybe will add some other file types in case of new ideas like mind maps, whatever needed.

###### In long term it could serve as a source of ideas for current and future governments and tech related companies to look for inspiration in  future reforms.

## Main targets:
###### - serve as a source of ideas in context of development of science

## Architecture.
###### I would like it to work as multiple layers. They would work hierarchically, so the lower levels would provide information and basis for next ones. First would be storytelling, so I would like to have short story, about some idea how things work elsewhere or more creatively how it would work here basing on a short story. Second would be ideas brought form previous layer. Next layer (third) would be finding of solutions how to bring them to life in our scenario (conditions). (...).
